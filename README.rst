sc22olj Final Project
==================

The codebase explores deep learning methods on 3d MRI scans for the purpose of classifying between ADNI subjects that are denoted CN (cognitively normal) and MCI (mild cognitive impairment), which is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease.

It provides modules for processing NifTi format 3D ADNI (or other MRI) data, modules for easily training pytorch deep learning models on these data, and a skeleton CDSS pipeline used to demonstrate the results of this project.
